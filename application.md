The Barcelona Past Networks Summer School will take place in the city of Barcelona (Spain) in June 2026. You can apply to participate by completing the below form. Places are limited, and will be offered following a review of all applications after the 26 January 2026 deadline. If you have been offered a place, then your offer will be conditional on paying the 75 EUR lunch fee.

<!-- Complete the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRwiSxn8N7E7KRjwP2v8M1zaEqrbR5oXoBeUb0kbnP5AuZtg/viewform?usp=sf_link). --> 


## Important Dates
* Application deadline: 26 January 2026
* Conditional offer of place in summer school: 11 February 2026
* Registration fee payment deadline: 4 March 2026
* Summer school dates: mid-June 2026 (to be confirmed)

## Application process
The application form includes a 400-word motivational statement that should clearly describe why you want to attend the BPNSS, and how you expect to benefit from the experience. No CV or other documentation is required. The submitted application forms will be reviewed by the [organizing committee](/team/#people), who will offer places and create a waiting list.

## Price
This is a free event and there is no registration fee. Registration includes:
* All coffee and tea breaks
* Organised social events
* One dinner
* All academic content and materials

The school includes four lunches for which a 75 EUR lunch fee needs to be paid at the registration phase. The lunch fee can only be paid once you have been offered a place in the summer school. Only bank transfers will be accepted (no cash or cheques).

Participants need to make their own arrangements for:
* Accommodation during the summer school (a list of participants will be created to support searching for accommodation together)
* Travel to and from the summer school
* Dinners (excluding one social dinner)
* Personal expenses at socials and during summer school

## Bursaries

The summer school is able to offer a small number of bursaries between 75 EUR and 300 EUR that can only be used to support expenses directly related to attending the Barcelona Past Networks Summer School. Eligible expenses include:
* BPNSS lunch fee
* Accommodation during the summer school
* Travel to and from the summer school

### Bursary application procedure
There is no separate bursary application procedure. You have to apply for a bursary alongside your application for the summer school, before the 26 January 2026 deadline.

In the application form, answer “Yes” to the question “Do you want to be considered for a bursary?”.
Please describe in no more than 200 words your motivation for applying for a bursary, listing concrete reasons.

## Financial Support

The free event and the bursaries are made possible thanks to our lecturers donating their time and work, the University of Barcelona providing venues, the [organizing institutions](/team/#made-possible-thanks-to), and thanks to generous support from The Carlsberg Foundation in the context of The Past Social Networks Project (CF21-0382).

## Privacy notice
Your answers to the questions on the application form will be accessed by the organisers as part of the selection process. The information collected via the form will be stored securely in password-protected environments and will not be shared with others. The personal information on the motivation statement and bursary application statement will be stored only until the end of the selection process (February 2026). 

Personal information is collected to ensure a balanced mix of participants in terms of gender, disciplinary background, career level, and country of residence. The same information will be retained in an anonymised form to ensure that the future editions of the summer school can be improved based upon the experience of the previous years. 

At any point, you may contact the organisers should you wish your data to be erased.
