##  Preparations for the BPNSS 2025:

As part of your preparation, please follow the instructions below to ensure that you are ready to engage fully in the program.

### Remember the following:
* Laptop with administrator rights in case you need to install software or packages on the fly. Please note that tablets cannot be used for the practicals of the summer school!
* Laptop charger cable.

### Preparations:
* Please install Gephi <https://gephi.org/>.
* Please install both R and RStudio separately: follow 1.1-1.3 of this tutorial <https://book.archnetworks.net/gettingstarted>. On that page you will find download links for R (which needs to be installed first) and R Studio and all instructions you need.
* (optional) In RStudio, consider already installing all packages that could be used in the tutorials, see section 2.3.  <https://book.archnetworks.net/dataandworkspace#PrimaryPackagesPlease> (this is particularly valuable for those with restricted administrator rights on their laptops).
*	Also check the suggested workspace setup in section 2.4 here <https://book.archnetworks.net/dataandworkspace#WorkspaceSetup>
*	(optional) Feel free to get familiar with RStudio by doing the rest of that tutorial 1.4-1.11.

### Prior reading and resources:
*	Check out this BPNSS document if you would like to do some reading ahead of the summer school, watch some tutorial videos, or explore the resources of our community: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4UwRiMOHDkpwfnVBH-fzylnya2-AlEV7fBhDj5lnyE/edit?usp=sharing>.
